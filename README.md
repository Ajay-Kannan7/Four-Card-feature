# Four-Card-feature
A four card feature design with some basic animations.

This four-card feature is built using HTML, CSS and has utilized media queries for resposniveness.

## What I learnt...
1) How to use transitions for smooth effects
Syntax
```
transition: [transition-property] [transition-duration] [transition-timing-function];
```
2) Animation using keyframes.

  i) Animation syntax
  ```
  animation:[animation-name] [animation-duration] [animation-timing-function];
  ```
  ii) Keyframes:  Used to animate on different stages or points of transition.
  ```
  @keyframes [animation-name]{
     0%{
     /*Code for animation at the beginning*/
     }
     50%{
     /*Code for aniamtion on the mid way through*/
     }
     100%{
     /*Code for animation at the end*/
     }
  }
   ```
